# MY C++ ROADMAP!
***learning C & C++ for fun (i am a masochist.)*** Plus trying out to code using Neovim/Vim VSCode extension.

Follow my struggle trying to learn a very complex, low-level programming language AND a complex text editor / IDE, AT THE SAME TIME! ðŸ˜Ž
Mainly got the neovim basics pretty fast. tutor is our god. Key repetitions suck ass on windows though, might have to fix this fast.

# GOALS:
1. Code myself a Web Browser (Chromium-based or nah.)
2. Code myself a Video Game (2Dand/or/maybe 3D.)
3. (list will go on & on...)

# EXPERIENCE:
Completly new to programming. Never code anything. I'll start by learning C, then C++n as i was told it's the best way to learn C++, by having some C basic understanding.

Followed a guide on YouTube, cool French dude giving me advices: Nice. C is *really* hard. like, proper low-level hard. a 'Hello World !' print look something like this:

    '''
    #include <stdio.h> //Header requiered for basics input & output.

    int main() {                          //'integer' function called 'main', will return 0 if no issues are detected.
        printf("Hello world !\n")         //'Printf' to print. "Hello World !" string to print. "\n" return line character.
        return 0;                         // The main function will return 0 if no issues are detected. return 1 if functin fail.
    }
    '''

C is a library based low-level language that is around since the 70's. There is a lot of support, guide & a big community behind it. Since C is so fast and low-level, it is mainly used for OS programming. (i.e The linux kernel, MacOS kernel & Windows Kernel.) You can actually code apps using C, but since it is a fixed, function based language, you'll lack the flexibility that offer C++.

C++ Is a paradigm, low-level, library based, object oriented language. Wich means that it offers low-level hardware control, with the flexibilty of High-level language synthax & you can switch between Object Oriented Programming (OOP) & a Functional Programming (FP) workflow.

I might only learn C++ to not get lost between the 2 synthax. I'll just learn the basic of C then full focus on C++, i think this is the way to go.
